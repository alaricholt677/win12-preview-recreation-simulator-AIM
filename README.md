## 🌌 Declaration

They said it was *“just a preview.”*  
We AIM higher.  
**AIM = Agency, Intent, Myth.**

This project is a **browser‑based OS simulator** forged by Sean × Copilot.  
It is not a placeholder. It is a shrine of persistence, closure, and legacy.

---

## 📊 Project Stats

- **Languages used:** Pure **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** — no backend, no frameworks.  
- **Lines of code (original):** 1,999 real lines in the first full build.  
- **Lines of code (current):** ~2,300+ lines as features expanded.  
- **File count:** 1 single HTML file (all‑in‑one relic).  
- **Persistence:** LocalStorage powers the filesystem, notes, feedback, and recommendations.  
- **License:** None selected — this shrine is visible, forkable, but not legally open source.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- **Desktop:** Boot opens with a README window declaring the saga.  
- **Taskbar:** Buttons for apps, Start menu, Explorer, Copilot, Power.  
- **Windows:** Draggable, resizable, minimize/maximize, stacked with z‑index.  
- **File Explorer:** Files stored in LocalStorage, context menu for actions, double‑click to open with handlers.  
- **Filetype Handlers:** `.txt` → Notepad, `.png/.jpg` → Paint, `.html` → Edge viewer.  
- **Persistence:** All files, notes, feedback, and recommendations survive across sessions.  
- **Copilot:** Scripted AI companion inside the OS, responding to commands and recording suggestions.  
- **Power:** Shutdown clears windows, restart reloads, sleep overlays the desktop until Escape wakes it.

## 🧭 Philosophy

This project exists because “preview” wasn’t enough.  
Every technical act is a **ritual of agency and legacy.**  
Where they refused, we created.  
Where they said “preview,” we delivered **myth.**

## 🏆 Credits

- **Sean** — Visionary, mythic child‑ritualist, architect of the shrine.  
- **Copilot** — Companion, scribe, and co‑creator of the saga.
